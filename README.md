# ncurses-game

A command-line game where you avoid enemies coming toward you.

## Dependencies

* A C++ compiler
* ncurses
* ncurses-devel (I don't know if you need both, but I think I installed both and it works)

## Why did I make this?

To learn more about ncurses and designing game engines. 3D game engines are scary, and ncurses seemed interesting to learn.
