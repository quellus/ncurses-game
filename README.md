# ncurses-game

A command-line game where you avoid enemies coming toward you.

## Why did I make this?

To learn more about ncurses and designing game engines. 3D game engines are scary, and ncurses seemed interesting to learn.

## Dependencies

* g++
* ncurses-devel (ncurses-dev on apt)

## Instructions

* cd into `src` directory
* run `make`
* run `./ncurses-game.out`
* move around using the arrow keys (or hjkl)
* avoid the enemies
